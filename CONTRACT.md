_This document describes our team social contract for this project_
Reference Establishing Norms

Roles (Will, Eric, Alex, Stan)
● Taskmaster - Will Golden
● Gitmaster - Eric Kreiter
● Testmaster - Alex Mok
● Mediator - Stan So

Daily process
● Morning standup started by yesterday's Taskmaster
○ New roles assigned going down the list of names and tasks
○ Obstacles? Goals for morning session and after lunch? (by today’s Taskmaster)
● Pair program on assigned tasks or issues that we weren't able to resolve individually
● Record issues, problems, and features we want to add right after lunch at re-group meeting
● After lunch have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and
plan for EOD merge
● After resolving problems split to individual tasks
● Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and
merge into master

Team expectations
● Each of us reserves the rights to our nights, and we have all been
straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
● If we decide to work on our own after hours we will communicate to the team our progress
● If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
● Share the mic
● Address person directly (over Slack) and immediately when problems arise
● Vote on disagreements and tiebreakers is left to mediator of the day
● Disagree often and discuss
● If we make no progress for 10-15 minutes ask for help on Slack initially
○ If no response after 15 minutes then ask verbally
○ Finally put in help ticket if still busy or no response

Possible Issue Resolution Attempts

1.  Take 10-15 minute break
2.  Take a walk or get some water
3.  Talk constructively about actionable items
4.  Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
